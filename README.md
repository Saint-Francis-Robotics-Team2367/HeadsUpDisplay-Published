# HUD
Heads-Up-Display Library using Open CV libraries

**Creator:** Jeevan Prakash

It is a library currently designed to be used with FRC robots or any vision system where the program will be displaying specific incoming data
coming from an onboard processing system in the form of gauges, bargraphs, lines of text, etc. on top of a video stream.

It is currently going to be tested with a live videostream through the use of the VideoCapture() class.
